						<p>Class Review</p>
						<p class = "blog">Throughout the semester, many people would ask me why I was taking a CSE course that had nothing to do with computer science and programming and I often asked myself the same question, but I can honestly say that I learned many valuable things about the technology world that I would not have learned in a programming class. The main thing we had to do for the class was create a website. I’m really glad we had to make a website for the class because it was something I always wanted to do, but just never got around to doing. I know a lot of people followed templates to create a website for the class (myself included), but in doing that I became interested in how everything worked together, so I spent the time to learn some HTML, CSS, and Javascript on my own. Overall I felt that this was the most valuable part of the class. The other assignments in the class included making a resume and cover letter, four guest lecture summaries, a policy memo, a user instruction guide on a product from the CES 2015 show, a press release, a literature review, and a research proposal. </p>

						<p class = "blog">The four guest speaker topics ranged from how to use the library databases, how the career center works and why it is necessary that we ask them for help when looking for a job, how companies use the internet to advertise based on what we view online, and how we can find out information and survey people in society. I found all of them very interesting, specifically the career center presentation by Joanna Durso, and the targeted advertising presentation by Tim Vassilakos. I didn't realize how important the career center was before this presentation, as I only went there once in my second semester for a resume review. I definitely plan on taking advantage of everything that they have to offer while I look for a job. </p>

						<p class = "blog">The policy memo was a cool assignment because it explored the aspect of being the head of a company and dispersing some set of rules to your employees about issues going on around the office. My policy memo was on the topic of internet usage around the office and how it had to be limited so employees could be productive. </p>

						<p class = "blog">My user instruction assignment and press release was on the Lynx Smart Grill. The Lynx Smart Grill is a “smart” grill that is able to cook food for the user by itself. The user needs no prior cooking experience as the grill will cook the food to the user's liking based on voice commands or through a smartphone application. When I saw that we were doing this assignment, I thought to myself, how hard can it be to write instructions for something? The truth is, when you actually sit down and think about all the little details you have to include, it’s actually a ton of information. You have to be extremely specific because you can't assume that everyone using your product is on your same intelligence level. Some things obvious to you are not obvious to others and information cannot be assumed. Something that I learned was that it’s important to explain everything like you are talking to a 5 year old. </p>

						<p class = "blog">The final two assignments were the literature review and the research proposal. The topic of my research proposal was how using too much technology and the internet affects social skills and behaviors. Growing up in this world, I constantly see people stare at their phones (I am a victim of this) instead of living in the moment. It is important to actually live and form real relationships with people. While I can see why people think it is easier to talk through text or social media, it is important that we STOP and put our phones away. Go out, meet new people, and form relationships. My research proposal was related to this same topic. The idea was to use electroencephalograms (EEG) testing to study and analyze the brain mappings of people who use the internet for 1-2 hours per day, and people who use the internet for more than 5 hours per day.This would be a great way to prove if using the internet too much can affect our brain activity and lead us into developing social phobias.Yes, you could always go the route of surveying people by asking if they use the internet a lot and if they feel they have social anxiety, but this is a more scientific way to do that same thing and I feel would give better evidence and factual support. </p>
